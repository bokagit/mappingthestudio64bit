<p id="about">
The art-project mappingthestudio64bit is a discipline-crossover of music/audio, image/moving-image and text, therefore it covers many different ways of art-creating.
This project explores the question: what will videoart and its presentation look like in the future with today's and tomorrow's digital technologies? And the question of which values or guidelines of a digital artwork  and its presentation must be noticed in the future.
For some time, I've been experimenting with the new digital technologies, which are developing at a rapid pace. Mainly the data/metadata-based technologies are developing particularly quickly, e.g., artificial intelligence (AI). I would like to deepen and research this upcoming field of creating art.
For me, art is a kind of language, a tool of communication of the thinking. From this perspective, abstraction in art is, in my opinion the way of visualizing and "talking" about thinking, the unconscious and the unknown. The data/metadata-based technologies also “visualize” and reveal the structures of the data, just as abstraction in art visualizes thinking, the unknown and the unconscious.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>This art-project consists of the following elements:</strong><br>
	<span class="spanStyle">
⁃	5&#42; video works - exhibited offline and online. <br>
⁃	a website.<br>
⁃	an event, debate.<br>
	<span style="font-size: .875rem; font-weight: 400;  vertical-align:middle;" >&#42; The fifth video work is a combination of all other videos.</span>
	</span>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>The technologies:</strong><br>
	<span class="spanStyle">
⁃	audio/ music digital technologies.<br>
⁃	visual digital technologies.<br>
⁃	data/ metadata -based processing of audio/music- and visual elements, including artificial intelligence (AI).<br>
⁃	web technologies html. css. js.<br>
⁃	other technologies.

	<a  class="link-heading" href="theVideoWorks.html">The video works:<img class="link-img" src="img/icons-hyperlink.png" alt="icone-link"></a>
	
	
The audio- and visual elements of the 5 video works were created using the technologies above and they are conceived as space-related installations.
In my experience, the creation of an artwork is, among other things, a series of conscious and intuitive decisions. In addition to the various audio/music- and visual digital technologies, data/metadata-based processing such as AI represents a new type of decision-making workflow. It intervenes in the decision-making process and produces new types of results.

	<a  class="link-heading" href="theWebsite.html">The website:<img class="link-img" src="img/icons-hyperlink.png" alt="icone-link"></a>

The Internet has led to a fundamental change in communication behavior and media use in the professional and private sphere. The cultural significance of this development is sometimes equated with the invention of the printing.
The following work is the main part of the site. It is published on the Internet and available online.<br>
<a href="https://mappingthestudio64bit.de">mappingthestudio64bit.de</a><br>
<i>Content of the website:</i><br>
<i>Mapping the Studio II with color shift, flip, flop, &#38; flip/flop (Fat Chance John Cage).</i><br>
This is the title of the video work by well-known artist Bruce Nauman.
<a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/nauman-mapping-the-studio-ii-with-color-shift-flip-flop-flip-flop-fat-chance-john-cage-t11893">link to the work </a><br>
This video installation, that he created in 2001, has two versions:<br>
<i>Mapping the Studio I (Fat Chance John Cage).</i><br>
<i>Mapping the Studio II with color shift, flip, flop, &#38; flip/flop (Fat Chance John Cage).</i><br>
The two versions differ in the degree of digital manipulation of the footage. MAPPING THE STUDIO II - the second version - uses the latest programs, that were available in 2001. From today's point of view, these programs are primary digital technologies.
	The work - mappingthestudio64bit .de (the website) - is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version">cover version</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_remake">remake</a> of Nauman's video installation. This work addresses the question: how would the video work MAPPING THE STUDIO II look like with today's technology?<br>

	<span class="spanStyle">
		The work consists of the following elements:<br>
⁃	a website with the domain name: appingthestudio64bit.de<br>
		⁃	five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24/7_service">24/7</a> livestream channels embedded and viewable on the website<br>
⁃	web-technology: html., css. and JavaScript technology – the latter being a computing technology that enables the viewer to use all of Nauman's digital manipulations interactively and in real time. All these manipulations are randomly activated and do not repeat

<p>
	
	<a  class="link-heading" href="theEventDebat.html">The event, debate:<img class="link-img" src="img/icons-hyperlink.png" alt="icone-link"></a>
The event will conclude this art-project. It is an element of the project, that most resembles the classic exhibition space. In time and space, all the elements of the art-project are available online or offline in original quality. However, the event takes place at a specific place and time. The event will be livestreamed, documented, and archived and will be available online. The topics of the event, debate are the values or guidelines of a digital artwork and its designed presentation, which are to be noticed today and will play a crucial role in the future.<br>

	<span class="spanStyle">
		Topics of the event, debate: <sup>&#42;</sup><br>
	⁃ the ecological footprint of a digital artwork and its designed presentation<br>	
	⁃ copyrights of a digital artwork and its designed - presentation<br>
	⁃ the accessibility of a digital artwork and its designed presentation<br>
	⁃ the meta level of a digital artwork and its designed presentation<br>
	⁃ the transparency of the creation of a digital artwork and its designed presentation<br>
		<span style="font-size: .875rem; font-weight: 400;  vertical-align:middle;" >&#42; The topics and the number of events or debates are subject to change and can be adjusted as needed.</span>

	<strong id="usability">Usability:</strong><br>
	The artwork "mappingthestudio64bit.de" is a complex work, composed of several different elements, which also stand as individual artworks. It's not the work itself, but the presentation of the work that is designed to respond to user preferences. The work is an algorithm that can be viewed or presented on different devices, such as projectors, flat screens, desktop computers, tablets, smartphones, and more. The user can be an intermediary, such as a teacher, curator, gallery, museum, collector, event manager, and more. This allows for a flexible and adaptable viewing experience targeted to cater to a wide range of audiences, contexts, and goals. This responsiveness in presentation is based on the definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_blank">responsive web design</a> but adapted to the "responsive art viewer"-approach, meaning that the way the digital art is presented adapts and responds to the different needs and preferences of the users, providing a consistent and optimal user experience.

The website has several buttons that allow users to interact with the installation. The "event" refers to Bruce Nauman’s installation that includes the following footage manipulations: "color shift“ - the screens imperceptibly mutate in colour from red, to green, to blue, then back to red over fifteen or twenty minute periods which vary from screen to screen and „flip, flop, &#38; flip/flop" - the screens flip from left to right and top to bottom at approximately fifteen minute, non-synchronised intervals.<br>
		
								<span class="spanStyle">
The buttons:<br>
-	The "random: onetime-event" button randomly rotates and changes the color of the livestream once.<br>
-	The "random: interval-event" button continuously rotates and changes the color of the livestream at random intervals.<br>
-	The "first-work: infrared light" button refers to Nauman's first installation without the mentioned effects.<br>
-	The "play all stream" button plays all the livestreams.<br>
-	The "reset" button resets all functions.<br>
-	The "oneWebPage" button excludes all elements that do not belong to the work, such as the logo, menu, and quick-links.<br>
Each window or livestream also has individual buttons for:<br>
								
-	"random: onetime-event", "random: interval-event" (same as the above mentioned buttons).<br>
-	"flip", "flop", "flip/flop", "color shift", which activate the functions once for each window or livestream.<br>
-	"fullsreen", "exit fullsreen", which activate and deactivate the function full screen for each window or livestream.<br>
