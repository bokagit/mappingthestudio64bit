Hybrid video-art exhibition
 
 The art project "mappingthestudio64bit" merges music, images, and text to explore the future of video art in the context of rapidly evolving digital technologies. It discusses the guidelines for presenting digital art in the future. The project comprises five video works exhibited both offline and online, a website, and a debate event. Created using data/metadata technologies and artificial intelligence, this complex artwork is designed to adapt its presentation to distinct user preferences across various devices and intermediaries, creating an optimal, personalized viewing experience. This approach mirrors the concept of responsive web design, termed here as the "responsive art viewer".

The collaboration between art and technology dates back to ancient times. My journey began in 2010 when I was fortunate enough to engage Richard Stallman to establish foundational norms. Presently, as the project has significantly advanced, I am reaching out to the open-source community, maakaf, for several reasons:

1. Improvement: Engaging with this community enables the enhancement of work through shared knowledge and expertise.
2. New Ideas: The open-source platform fosters innovation and creative thinking, inspiring new concepts and ideas.
3. Reasoning: It promotes analytical discussions and logical debates, enhancing the perspective on the work.
4. Presentation Platform: Maakaf provides a diverse and broad audience, offering a robust platform to showcase and get feedback for the artwork.
5. Dialogue Between Art and Technology: The association with maakaf will establish an invaluable bridge between the realms of art and modern technologies, fostering a meaningful dialogue.
